Learning to use Github

Hello!

Rob here! I'm new to the tech world but have taken to it like a kid at Christmas. I've been learning through freecodecamp.org where I began with the Resposive Web Design Certification and only have the projects to complete. I spend most of my freetime after work learning or practicing and would love to connect with others whether they be experienced or a newbie like myself.
